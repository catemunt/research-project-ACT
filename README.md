# 289312 Independent Research Project

##### By Cate Munt 19031686

## The Project

I used this Creative Tech Project to further the development of my Major Project.  My idea is to use physical computing to represent data in the project coming from the physical interactions from the audience and from the data held in the Unreal project. My Major Project, "The Train Of Many Stations" is an immersive art and technology installation where the audience enters a train carriage and are transported to different worlds, all from inside the train. It will use a combination of a custom-built interactive set and real-time rendering via Unreal Engine. We also aim to include interactive elements to further immerse and engage the audience. These interactions include having ambient lighting in the train that responds to the colour data from the world that is being travelled through and also having set lighting cycles that are triggered in different worlds, that create different ambiences. Upon the completion of this project, I hope to have a working prototype of the lighting procedures and ambient lighting that is triggered by a moving scene in Unreal. 

## The Tech
### Software
#### Unreal Engine
"Unreal Engine is the worldâ€™s most open and advanced real-time 3D creation tool. Continuously evolving to serve not only its original purpose as a state-of-the-art game engine, today it gives creators across industries the freedom and control to deliver cutting-edge content, interactive experiences, and immersive virtual worlds." 

#### Ue4Duino Plugin
"Use this plugin to communicate with Arduino or other COM port devices on Windows."

#### Arduino Libraries
The Arduino environment can be extended through the use of libraries. (e.g neopixel library etc.)

### Hardware
#### Programmable Circuit Boards
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs and turn them into outputs. Arduino senses the environment by receiving inputs from many sensors and affects its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other actuators.

#### Addressable Lights:
I plan to use addressable lighting (probably strips) to represent the world colours in the installation. I have been looking into using Adafruit Neopixels. 

## Development
* The next step from the first prototype was to get the second LED strip to work and respond to the code.
* Once I got them both working, it was time to get them working and responding to the code at the same time. 
* This worked (as shown below) but I then ran into a new unexpected problem, where the lights would react to the code if the other light was in the process of changing or being in a delay phase.

* This issue is with the delay function, where the serial is seen as busy when carrying out the delay. 
* I did some research and found that this is a common problem with Arduino, and can be solved with the time function millis().
* I rewrote my code using the milis() function as a timekeeper, allowing for both strips to be carrying out different functions at the same time.

## The Setup
#### Arduino Setup:
* Arduino is connected to the computer
* Both LED strips are connected to the 5V power supply using a breadboard
* Strip one is connected on pin 3, strip two is connected on pin 6 
* Both are connected to separate ground pins

#### Arduino Code Setup:
* The code monitors the serial port to see if there is any available information
* If so, it reads the string sent from the Unreal project and triggers the correct strip, led and corresponding colour
* It uses the milis() function to act in place of the delay function, to allow for each LED to come on at a specific time. 
* When the Unreal Level is exited the lights will all turn off. 

#### Unreal Blueprint Setup - Triggers + Arduino Connection:
* These are the blueprints that read the data sent by the different coloured trigger boxes. 
* The first is the setup connection to the arduino serial port, where you have to specify the com port and the baud rate being used by the arduino. 
* The second is the function to send the strings that correspond to the different colour scripts to the arduino serial port. 
* This was a change I made from the original script to free up the serial port so data is only being read/sent when needed.

#### Unreal Blueprint Setup - Colour Triggers:
* This is the blueprint for the blue colour trigger inside the Unreal level.
* It sends a signal to the Triggers script with the bluecollision string when the blue trigger box is collided with that gets sent to the arduino serial port.
* It also sends a string that turns off all lights when the collision trigger box is left.

### Further Development

* [x] Convert all delays to milis
* [x] Get White lights responding to a set looping on/off function
* [ ] Create more functions for in train lighs for different situations
* [ ] Create triggers in scene for extra functions
* [ ] Test trigger functions with new level loading sequences
* [ ] Test out program with more lights and more strips
* [ ] Test with external power source


## Unreal Project Files
I had to uplaod the Unreal project file to google drive, as the file size was too big for github.
